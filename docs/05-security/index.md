🚨 AI Agents Are Getting Smarter — But Are They Secure? 🤖🔐
As AI agents become increasingly autonomous and capable — from scheduling meetings to writing code and even making business decisions — the question of security becomes more urgent than ever.

🔍 The Rise of Autonomous AI
Tools like AutoGPT, AgentGPT, and enterprise copilots are pushing the boundaries of what AI can do without human intervention.
These agents can browse the web, execute code, and interact with APIs — all with minimal oversight.

🛡️ The Security Risks
Prompt injection and data leakage are real threats.
Supply chain vulnerabilities: AI agents often rely on third-party APIs and plugins.
Over-permissioned agents: Granting too much access to sensitive systems or data can be catastrophic.

🧠 Smarter ≠ Safer
Intelligence doesn’t imply security. In fact, the smarter the agent, the more damage it could potentially cause if compromised.
We need AI-specific security frameworks and zero-trust principles applied to autonomous agents.

🔐 What Can Be Done?
Implement sandboxing and access controls.
Use auditing and logging to track agent behavior.
Encourage red teaming and adversarial testing of AI systems.
